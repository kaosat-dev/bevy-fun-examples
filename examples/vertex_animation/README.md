# Vertex_animation

This example showcases how to do animation (in this case, animating a fish) using only a vertex shader .
It is a very powerfull and yet simple method, and "programmer friendl" as it does not require any complex visual assets with IK etc.

This example is based both on some of my older work with vertex shader animation and [this amazing tutorial for the Godot engine](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/performance/vertex_animation/animating_thousands_of_fish.html)
