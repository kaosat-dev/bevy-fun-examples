# Blender_gltf_components

This example, is actually closer to a boilerplate + tooling showcases how to do animation (in this case, animating a fish) using only a vertex shader .
It is a very powerfull and yet simple method, and "programmer friendl" as it does not require any complex visual assets with IK etc.
