A few different examples for bevy (not the official examples :)

Tested with Bevy 0.9.1


## List of examples

### [Vertex Animation](./examples/vertex_animation/README.md)
- vertex shader animation (specifically for animation fishes etc) 

    run it with ```cargo run --example vertex_animation```


## Notes

- feedback is welcome, although I do not know how much time I will have to update this repo
- my Rust & Bevy knowledge is limited for now, so suggestions to make things more idiomatic are welcome !
